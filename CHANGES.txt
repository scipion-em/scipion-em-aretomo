3.9.0:
  Users:
    - The protocol form now present CTF-related parameters, to choose if estimate it or
      not and phase plate acquisition related params (estimate the phase shift).
    - Generates the output SetOfCtfTomoSeries if the CTF files are found
    - Add dataimport module to parse the CTF generated so it can be called from the
      centralized protocol for importing CTFs.
    - Fix the origin set by Scipion to the generated tomograms.
    - Outputs are not stored in case the are not correctly generated.
    - If dose-weighting active, the accumulated dose of the interpolated TS is set to zero  to avoid double dose
      correction if using the interp TS for the PPPT.
  Developers:
    - Rewrite tests using the TCL from em-tomo and the reliontomo test dataset.
