3.10.3:
 Users:
  - Fix the even/odd functionality.
3.10.2:
 Users:
  - Fix odd/even functionality.
  - Fix the write aln file method so it works no matter if the tilt-series header identifies it as a stack
    or as a volume.
 Developers:
  - Add some preventing locks in the steps generator step to prevent the recursive use of cursors that makes
    streamified protocols to close the output before expected.
  - Replace the setup.py by the corresponding pyproject.toml.
  - Improve the method readingOutput.
  - Improve robustness in streaming: check the tilt-series size before inserting the steps.
3.10.1:
 Users:
  - Fix: re-align aligned tilt-series after having excluded views is now possible (validation is now a warning).
3.10.0:
 Users:
  - Add input tilt-series excluded views management.
  - Add odd/even tomograms reconstruction,
  - Fix: amplitude contrast is read from the tilt-series metadata and passed to AreTomo.
  - Do not support old AreTomo versions.
 Developers:
  - Write new tests with a better characterized test dataset.
  - Tests renewed with a better adapted (real dark frames) test dataset and with cases of TS with excluded views.
  - Add needsgpu attribute to the steps generation.
  - Aln file writer method added to adapt the plugin to the API of AreTomo2-1.1.3 when only reconstructing the tomograms.
  - Fix indirect pointers.
3.9.5: add aretomo2 1.1.3
3.9.4: set aretomo2 1.0.0 as default, because 1.1.2 has broken remove dark option
3.9.3: hotfix: _defineVariables method must be a class method to be compatible with scipion command config -p
3.9.2:
   - Aretomo does nos fail when closing its output when process is killed
   - Listed protocol's names are defaults ones.
   - Tolerate failed tilt-series, avoiding the protocol interruption and generating a specific output for the failed
     tilt-series.
   - Force enable DW when saving extra IMOD output
  Developers:
   - Steps now use the tsId instead of the objId.
3.9.1:
  Users:
   - Add aretomo2 1.1.2
   - Fix backwards compatibility.
   - Add an option to specify AlignZ per TS.
   - fix dose weighting bug related to the tilt angle file (aretomo2 only)
  Developers:
   - The tests now use the Test Centralization Layer update and expansion of the used test set definition
     from em-tomo v3.6.0.
   - Update the acquisition order in the CTFTomo objects (field added to that class in scipion-em-tomo v3.7.0).
3.9.0:
  Users:
    - The protocol form now present CTF-related parameters, to choose if estimate it or
      not and phase plate acquisition related params (estimate the phase shift).
    - Generates the output SetOfCtfTomoSeries if the CTF files are found
    - Add dataimport module to parse the CTF generated so it can be called from the
      centralized protocol for importing CTFs.
    - Fix the origin set by Scipion to the generated tomograms.
    - Outputs are not stored in case the are not correctly generated.
    - If dose-weighting active, the accumulated dose of the interpolated TS is set to zero  to avoid double dose
      correction if using the interp TS for the PPPT.
  Developers:
    - Rewrite tests using the TCL from em-tomo and the reliontomo test dataset.

3.8:
    - add aretomo2 1.0.0

3.5.1: add aretomo 1.3.3
3.5:
 - get rid of xf file conversion, use aln directly
 - add aretomo 1.3.0
 - update citation
3.4: always output stack with alignment info
